I am currently pursuing B.Tech + MS by Research in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT-Hyderabad</a>. I am highly interested in working on various research problems in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Computational Social Science. Currently, I am working on my Master's Thesis with <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/m.shrivastava/">Professor Manish Shrivastava</a> on Neural Machine Translation for Low-Resource languages and, Translation and Generation of Code-Mixed sentences. 

I am also working with <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vgandhi/">Professor Vineet Gandhi</a> on improving the generalization ability of Image Classification models on unseen domains. Moreover, I am working on the detection of religious Hate Speech on online social media platforms such as Twitter, advised by <a href="https://precog.iiit.ac.in/">Professor Ponnurangam Kumaraguru â€œPK"</a> and <a href="https://jisun.me/">Professor Jisun An</a>.

        <p>Worked on grounding knowledge graphs to impart commonsense knowledge to Question-Answering models for Multiple Choice QA task. We use Graph Convolution Networks to encode the information from the gounded knowledge graph, and use the dense representation along with the semantic featues for classification. The proposed new grounding method creates a dense schema graph, and enhances the performance of the QA models.
