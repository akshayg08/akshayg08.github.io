I am currently pursuing B.Tech + MS by Research in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT-Hyderabad</a>. I am highly interested in working on various research problems in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Computational Social Science. Currently, I am working on my Master's Thesis with <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/m.shrivastava/">Professor Manish Shrivastava</a> on Neural Machine Translation for Low-Resource languages and, Translation and Generation of Code-Mixed sentences. 

I am also working with <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vgandhi/">Professor Vineet Gandhi</a> on improving the generalization ability of Image Classification models on unseen domains. Moreover, I am working on the detection of religious Hate Speech on online social media platforms such as Twitter, advised by <a href="https://precog.iiit.ac.in/">Professor Ponnurangam Kumaraguru â€œPK"</a> and <a href="https://jisun.me/">Professor Jisun An</a>.
